# Bike Sales Excel Project
**The focus is to answer the following business questions:**

- Which region has the highest bike sales?
- Is there a correlation between the distance a person commutes and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
- Which occupation types are more likely to purchase a bike?
- Which gender is more likely to purchase a bike?
- What is the average income of bike purchasers?
- What is the relationship between education level and bike purchases? Overall trend of profit and sales over time

**Key Takeaways**
1. There is a correlation between gender, income, and bike purchasing behavior, with males having a higher likelihood of both having a high income and purchasing bikes compared to females.
2. North America has the highest bike sales volume compared to other regions.
3. Management occupations are more likely to purchase bikes, followed by clerical occupations.
4. There is no significant difference between the number of people who purchased bikes compared to those who did not purchase them. The middle age bracket has a higher frequency of bike purchasing compared to other age brackets.
